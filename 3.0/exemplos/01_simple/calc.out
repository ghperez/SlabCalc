     Parallel version (MPI), running on     8 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input
     Message from routine read_cards :
     DEPRECATED: no units specified in ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
     Message from routine read_cards :
     ATOMIC_POSITIONS: units set to alat

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = VDW-DF ( 1  4  4  0 1 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want

               file C.pbe-rrkjus.UPF: wavefunction(s)  2S 2P renormalized

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
